# RESTAURANT RECOMMENDER USING K-MEANS CLUSTERING

## Overview

Welcome to the Restaurant Recommender Project! In this project, we will leverage unsupervised learning and K-Means clustering to create a recommendation system for restaurants in various neighborhoods of Bangalore, including Whitefield, Electronic City, Bellandur, and other areas. Our goal is to assist users in finding restaurants that match their preferences based on the clustering of similar restaurants.

## Dataset

Our dataset is collected from various sources, including online reviews, restaurant websites, and user ratings. It includes information about the restaurant's location, cuisine, price range, and user reviews. This data will serve as the foundation for our recommendation system.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before diving into this project, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- **Python** (version 3.7 or higher)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (optional but highly recommended)
- **Scikit-Learn** and **Pandas** libraries for machine learning and data manipulation.

## Data Preprocessing

To build an effective restaurant recommender system, we need to preprocess the data appropriately:

### Data Collection

We gather data from various sources, ensuring that we have detailed information about restaurants in different Bangalore neighborhoods. This includes data on restaurant names, locations, cuisines, price ranges, and user reviews.

### Feature Engineering

1. **Text Analysis**: We perform text analysis on user reviews to extract sentiments and identify keywords related to restaurant features like ambiance, service, and food quality.

2. **One-Hot Encoding**: We convert categorical features such as cuisine type and price range into binary form using one-hot encoding.

## Unsupervised Learning with K-Means Clustering

We apply K-Means clustering to group restaurants into clusters based on their characteristics. The key steps include:

1. **Feature Scaling**: Normalize numerical features like user ratings to have the same scale as one-hot encoded categorical features.

2. **K-Means Clustering**: We run the K-Means algorithm on the preprocessed dataset to cluster restaurants into k clusters. The choice of k will depend on experimentation and optimizing cluster quality.

3. **Cluster Analysis**: We analyze the clusters to understand the common features and characteristics of restaurants within each cluster.

## Restaurant Recommendation

To recommend restaurants to users, we employ the following steps:

1. **User Input**: Users provide input, such as their preferred location, cuisine, and price range.

2. **Matching Cluster**: We identify the cluster(s) that best match the user's input.

3. **Recommendation**: Based on the cluster(s) identified, we recommend restaurants from those clusters to the user.

## Conclusion

- Building a restaurant recommender system using unsupervised learning and K-Means clustering is an exciting project that can provide valuable recommendations to users based on their preferences and the characteristics of restaurants.

- The success of the recommender system will depend on the quality and diversity of the dataset, the choice of features, and the number of clusters. Experimentation and fine-tuning will be essential to create an effective recommendation engine.

- By clustering restaurants in various Bangalore neighborhoods, we can offer users a personalized dining experience and help them discover new restaurants that match their tastes, whether they are looking for a cozy eatery in Whitefield or a trendy spot in Electronic City.
